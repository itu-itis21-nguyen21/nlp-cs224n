My code for the NLP with Deep Learning course, which I picked up on my own a few years ago. Needless to say, the code is very messy and somebody out there probably did a much better job than I do. The first assignment was from the course batch given in 2017, while the rest were from the 2021 batch. 

Oh and where is assignment 2? Most likely a dog ate it.

- Assignment 1: Neural Network basics, word2vec, Sentiment Analysis
- Assignment 3: Neural Transition-based Dependency Parsing
- Assignment 4: RNNs, LSTMs, Neural Machine Translation
- Assignment 5: Self-Attention, Transformers, Pretraining
- Final Project: BERT, Fine-tuning, Multitask Learning
